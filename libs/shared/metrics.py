"""Prometheus metrics: one small module, deliberately identical in mytheus-backend and
mytheus-intelligence (each repo owns its copy; no cross-repo imports).

Canonical metric names are documented in mytheus-backend/design/metrics.md.

Cardinality and privacy rules (do not relax):
  - HTTP series are labelled by the matched ROUTE TEMPLATE (``/api/v1/meetings/{meeting_id}``),
    never the raw path. Unmatched paths collapse to ``unmatched``.
  - No ``org_id``, ``user_id`` or any other tenant/person identifier is ever a label value.
  - Consumer series are labelled by group/topic/outcome only.
